\arguments{
\item{particles_to_fuse}{list of length m, where particles_to_fuse[c] contains
the particles for the c-th sub-posterior. Can
initialise a this from list of sub-posterior samples
by using the intialise_particle_sets function}

\item{N}{number of samples}

\item{m}{number of sub-posteriors to combine}

\item{time}{time T for fusion algorithm}

\item{dim}{dimension of the predictors (= p+1)}

\item{data_split}{list of length m where each item is a list of length 2 where
for c=1,...,m, data[[c]]$y is the vector for y responses and
data[[c]]$x is the design matrix for the covariates for sub-posterior c}

\item{prior_means}{prior for means of predictors}

\item{prior_variances}{prior for variances of predictors}

\item{C}{overall number of sub-posteriors}

\item{resampling_method}{method to be used in resampling, default is multinomial
resampling ('multi'). Other choices are stratified
resampling ('strat'), systematic resampling ('system'),
residual resampling ('resid')}

\item{ESS_threshold}{number between 0 and 1 defining the proportion of the
number of samples that ESS needs to be lower than for
resampling (i.e. resampling is carried out only when
ESS < N*ESS_threshold)}

\item{diffusion_estimator}{choice of unbiased estimator for the Exact Algorithm
between "Poisson" (default) for Poission estimator
and "NB" for Negative Binomial estimator}

\item{beta_NB}{beta parameter for Negative Binomial estimator (default 10). If Poisson
estimator used, then this can be ignored}

\item{bounds_multiplier}{scalar value to mulitply bounds by
(should greater than or equal to 1)}

\item{seed}{seed number - default is NULL, meaning there is no seed}

\item{n_cores}{number of cores to use}

\item{level}{indicates which level this is for the hierarchy (default 1)}

\item{node}{indicates which node this is for the hierarchy (default 1)}

\item{precondition_matricies}{list of length m, where precondition_matrices[[c]]
is the precondition matrix for sub-posterior c}
}

A list with components:
\describe{
  \item{particles}{particles returned from fusion sampler}

  \item{time}{run-time of fusion sampler}

             sample size of the particles after each step BEFORE deciding
             whether or not to resample for level l, node i}
  \item{CESS}{list of length (L-1), where CESS[[l]][[i]] is the conditional
              effective sample size of the particles after each step}
  \item{resampled}{list of length (L-1), where resampled[[l]][[i]] is a
                   boolean value to record if the particles were resampled
                   after each step; rho and Q for level l, node i}
  \item{precondition_matrices}{list of length 2 where precondition_matrices[[2]]
                               are the pre-conditioning matrices that were used
                               and precondition_matrices[[1]] are the combined
                               precondition matrices}
  \item{combined_data}{combined data for the fusion density}
