\arguments{
\item{particles_to_fuse}{list of length m, where particles_to_fuse[c] contains
the particles for the c-th sub-posterior. Can
initialise a this from list of sub-posterior samples
by using the intialise_particle_sets function}

\item{N}{number of samples}

\item{m}{number of sub-posteriors to combine}

\item{time}{time T for fusion algorithm}

\item{dim}{dimension of the predictors (= p+1)}

\item{data_split}{list of length m where each item is a list of length 4 where
for c=1,...,m, data[[c]]$y is the vector for y responses and
data[[c]]$x is the design matrix for the covariates for
sub-posterior c, data[[c]]$full_data_count is the unique
rows of the full data set with their counts and 
data[[c]]$design_count is the unique rows of the design
matrix and their counts}

\item{prior_means}{prior for means of predictors}

\item{prior_variances}{prior for variances of predictors}

\item{C}{overall number of sub-posteriors}

\item{resampling_method}{method to be used in resampling, default is multinomial
resampling ('multi'). Other choices are stratified
resampling ('strat'), systematic resampling ('system'),
residual resampling ('resid')}

\item{ESS_threshold}{number between 0 and 1 defining the proportion of the
number of samples that ESS needs to be lower than for
resampling (i.e. resampling is carried out only when
ESS < N*ESS_threshold)}

\item{cv_location}{string to determine what the location of the control variate
should be. Must be either 'mode' where the MLE estimator 
will be used or 'hypercube_centre' (default) to use the centre
of the simualted hypercube}

\item{diffusion_estimator}{choice of unbiased estimator for the Exact Algorithm
between "Poisson" (default) for Poission estimator
and "NB" for Negative Binomial estimator}

\item{beta_NB}{beta parameter for Negative Binomial estimator (default 10)}

\item{gamma_NB_n_points}{number of points used in the trapezoidal estimation
of the integral found in the mean of the negative
binomial estimator (default is 2)}

\item{seed}{seed number - default is NULL, meaning there is no seed}

\item{n_cores}{number of cores to use}

\item{cl}{an object of class "cluster" for parallel computation in R. If none
is passed, then one is created and used within other functions}

\item{level}{indicates which level this is for the hierarchy (default 1)}

\item{node}{indicates which node this is for the hierarchy (default 1)}

\item{print_progress_iters}{number of iterations between each progress update
(default is 1000). If NULL, progress will only
be updated when importance sampling is finished}

\item{precondition_matricies}{list of length m, where precondition_matrices[[c]]
is the precondition matrix for sub-posterior c}
}

A list with components:
\describe{
  \item{particles}{particles returned from fusion sampler}
  \item{proposed_samples}{proposal samples from fusion sampler}
  \item{time}{run-time of fusion sampler}
  \item{ESS}{list of length (L-1), where ESS[[l]][[i]] is the effective
             sample size of the particles after each step BEFORE deciding
             whether or not to resample for level l, node i}
  \item{CESS}{list of length (L-1), where CESS[[l]][[i]] is the conditional
              effective sample size of the particles after each step}
  \item{resampled}{list of length (L-1), where resampled[[l]][[i]] is a
                   boolean value to record if the particles were resampled
                   after each step; rho and Q for level l, node i}
  \item{precondition_matrices}{list of length 2 where precondition_matrices[[2]]
                               are the pre-conditioning matrices that were used
                               and precondition_matrices[[1]] are the combined
                               precondition matrices}
  \item{combined_data}{combined data for the fusion density}
