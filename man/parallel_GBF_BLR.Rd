\arguments{
\item{particles_to_fuse}{list of length m, where particles_to_fuse[c] contains
the particles for the c-th sub-posterior. Can
initialise a this from list of sub-posterior samples
by using the initialise_particle_sets function}

\item{N}{number of samples}

\item{m}{number of sub-posteriors to combine}

\item{time_mesh}{time mesh used in Bayesian Fusion}

\item{dim}{dimension of the predictors (= p+1)}

\item{data_split}{list of length m where each item is a list of length 4 where
for c=1,...,m, data_split[[c]]$y is the vector for y responses and
data_split[[c]]$x is the design matrix for the covariates for
sub-posterior c, data_split[[c]]$full_data_count is the unique
rows of the full data set with their counts and 
data_split[[c]]$design_count is the unique rows of the design
matrix and their counts}

\item{prior_means}{prior for means of predictors}

\item{prior_variances}{prior for variances of predictors}

\item{C}{overall number of sub-posteriors}

\item{precondition_matrices}{list of length m, where precondition_matrices[[c]]
is the precondition matrix for sub-posterior c}

\item{resampling_method}{method to be used in resampling, default is multinomial
resampling ('multi'). Other choices are stratified
resampling ('strat'), systematic resampling ('system'),
residual resampling ('resid')}

\item{ESS_threshold}{number between 0 and 1 defining the proportion of the
number of samples that ESS needs to be lower than for
resampling (i.e. resampling is carried out only when
ESS < N*ESS_threshold)}

\item{cv_location}{string to determine what the location of the control variate
should be. Must be either 'mode' where the MLE estimator 
will be used or 'hypercube_centre' (default) to use the centre
of the simulated hypercube}

\item{sub_posterior_means}{matrix with m rows and d columns, where sub_posterior_means[c,]
is the sub-posterior mean of sub-posterior c}

\item{adaptive_mesh}{logical value to indicate if an adaptive mesh is used
(default is FALSE)}

\item{adaptive_mesh_parameters}{list of parameters used for adaptive mesh.
Items which can be included are data_size,
b (population variance if vanilla BF is used),
k3, k4 (determines CESS_j threshold), T2
(regular mesh recommended), vanilla (logical
value to indicate if vanilla BF guidance is used)}

\item{diffusion_estimator}{choice of unbiased estimator for the Exact Algorithm
between "Poisson" (default) for Poisson estimator
and "NB" for Negative Binomial estimator}

\item{beta_NB}{beta parameter for Negative Binomial estimator (default 10)}

\item{gamma_NB_n_points}{number of points used in the trapezoidal estimation
of the integral found in the mean of the negative
binomial estimator (default is 2)}

\item{local_bounds}{logical value indicating if local bounds for the phi function
are used (default is TRUE)}

\item{seed}{seed number - default is NULL, meaning there is no seed}

\item{n_cores}{number of cores to use}

\item{cl}{an object of class "cluster" for parallel computation in R. If none
is passed, then one is created and used within this function}

\item{level}{indicates which level this is for the hierarchy (default 1)}

\item{node}{indicates which node this is for the hierarchy (default 1)}

\item{print_progress_iters}{number of iterations between each progress update
(default is 1000). If NULL, progress will only
be updated when importance sampling is finished}
