# hierarchicalFusion

Code to implement experiments from [Divide-and-Conquer Monte Carlo Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07265) by Ryan S.Y. Chan, Adam M. Johansen, Murray Pollock and Gareth O. Roberts.

Note: package has been renamed to 'DCFusion' but the repo is still called 'hierarchicalFusion' for now since that is what the current arxiv and submitted version has linked to. Will change when this gets updated.
